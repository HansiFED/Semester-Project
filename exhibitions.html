                    <p>We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. </p>
                    <p>Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

                    <p> For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? </p>
                    <p>Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.  </p>
                    <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                    <p> As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.  </p>
                    <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. </p>
                    <p>But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future. </p>

                    <p> From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.   </p>
                    <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.  </p>
                    <p>Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.  </p>
                    <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
