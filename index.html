            <p>
              Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come
              on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn
              about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel
              back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth?
            </p>
            <p>
              Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds,
              so make sure you come ready to learn and explore. We also have the
              Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between
              10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and experiment with
              our team of experts. During the school holidays we run special
              holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on
              a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to
              explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can
              join, send us a message.

          <h3>“Explore together”</h3>
          <p>
            Over the course of human history, science has developed from our
            early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
            everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
            life itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
            experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
            lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
            brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
            different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
            explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact
            with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
            dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s
            gone home).
