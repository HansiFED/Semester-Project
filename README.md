## Description

My Noroff semester project where our task was to make a webpage for a museum (we had not learnt to use javascript at this time) that would appeal to kids between the ages 7-15.
This was our task: "The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; while aiming at a younger audience it should not patronise them with overtly childish themes. The core purpose of the site is to excite and entice people to visit the museum."
The whole purpose of the website is to act more like information pamphlet with visuals and there is not a whole lot of functionality due to the nature of not having javascript included aswell. 

However I feel like it turned out great, I scored a 92/100 for the marking criteria and went with a light design that was bright and colorful to inspire kids and youngsters.
